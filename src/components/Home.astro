    <h3>OpenPokeTCG</h3>
    <p>
      A while back I wanted to make a little tool that would track the prices of
      Pokemon cards that I wanted on eBay. I had assumed that there would be
      easily accessible card data to build this on top of, but I found that the
      only cards with good API coverage were the English ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to try and get this data myself, with the philosophy of making
      it completely open source, creating a public API for quick use, but also
      the service to create the database from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frustratingly, information on cards is scattered and often sites jealously
      guard the data they've gathered. So I'm taking the approach of using wikis
      - complying with their robots.txt rules - and turning them into data
      available to everyone.

    <p>The project is just at the start of its journey, watch this space!</p>
